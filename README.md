## How to compile and run

### Change directory
```
cd src
```

### Compile
```
g++ operation.cpp precedence.cpp main.cpp -o main
```

### Run

<<<<<<< HEAD
There is a `test.txt` file in `test` folder to store all the test cases, where each line is one test case and it is space-insensitive. 

Run the code below and check `out.txt` in that same folder or terminal for outputs.
